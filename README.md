# data-jam-july-2017

The dataset used for the July 2017 Data Jam was the spectrometer data generated by the ChemCam complex aboard NASA's Mars Science Laboratory rover (Curiosity).

The script provided here graphs the density of each of the compounds included in the ChemCam data at each observed location within the Gale Crater. This density was expressed as a scatter plot of each location observed according to its geographic coordinates, colored by the density of the element in question.

Due to the fact that Curiosity covered a much narrower path than expected, the data failed to yield the anticipated insights. While there was some variation in the data, the graphs effectively yielded only a map of the rover's path across the crater.
